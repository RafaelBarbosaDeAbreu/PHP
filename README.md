## About the project
In short, the project was developed to help solve a problem that existed at the school, which was knowing where each teacher was, something that made students waste a lot of time and, consequently, be late for classes. On this website, students can see a table in real time showing where each teacher is within the school. This table is fed by an administrator who can make changes if there are any errors or last-minute updates, can also remove teachers if there is a dismissal and, lastly, can also register a new administrator.
